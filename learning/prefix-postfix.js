/*Prefix Examples */

// let pre = 10;
// console.log(pre);
// console.log(++pre);  // ans = 11.. bcos we added ++ before pre, so its value is incresed by plus 1
// console.log(--pre);  // ans = 10.. after adding plus 1 from from previous console log we got ans 11. But when we added -- before pre its value is again become 10, bcos -- substrated -1 from the last console answer which was 11.

/*Postfix Examples */

let post = 10;
console.log(post);
console.log(post--); // ans = 10.. value remains the same because we have used postfix means -- after the value, but the next console log value would be 9
console.log(post);  // ans = 9.. its bcos the previous console log uses -- after post. so the next console answer would be 10-1 = 9.
